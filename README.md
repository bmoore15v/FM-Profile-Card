## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge gave me some issues with placing backgroud images. I learned more about `backgroound-position` and how to move images to the correct place.

### Continued development

I would like to woke more on `position`. I had a hard time figuring out how to positoion a few elements and how they relate to the rest of the elements. Additionally, I would like to grow in my understanding of adding CSS elements. I would add things and then that would break other things.
